# hifive1b_bootloader
Reverse engineer of the hifive1 rev b bootloader since the source has not been released

The old/ directory is where the original hex and decompiled assembly from it are. old/hifive_revb_bootloader.S contains comments as to what the assembly is doing.

entry.S, main.c, etc. are the reversed engineered bootloader (wip)
